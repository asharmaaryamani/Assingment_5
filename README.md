# SVM Optimization on UCI Dataset

This repository presents a project on optimizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) for a multi-class classification problem using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to identify the best hyperparameters for an SVM classifier across 10 different randomized samples.

## üìä Dataset Used
**Letter Recognition** dataset from UCI:
- Features: 16 numerical attributes
- Target: 26 capital letters (A-Z)
- Total Samples: 20,000

---

## üîß Methodology
1. **Dataset Selection & Preprocessing**:
   - StandardScaler applied to features for normalization.

2. **Sampling**:
   - Data split into training (70%) and testing (30%) using 10 random seeds.

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Optimized `NuSVC` with 100 random combinations of:
     - `kernel` = ['linear', 'rbf', 'poly']
     - `nu` from 0.1 to 0.9
     - `epsilon` from 0.01 to 0.2
   - Best accuracy and parameters were recorded per sample.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Accuracy recorded over iterations
   - Convergence graph plotted for the sample with the highest accuracy
